## 🛣️ The Contribution Journey

### 🔍 Step 1: Issue Discovery & Hygiene
* **Check for Duplicates:** Search the Issues Tab to ensure your idea hasn't been reported.
* **Request Assignment:** Comment on an issue to be assigned. **Wait for Admin approval** before you start coding.
* **Raising New Issues:** Clearly describe the "What" and "Why" using the provided templates.

### 🌿 Step 2: Branching Strategy
Always create a dedicated branch for your work to keep the main branch stable.
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature
 
### 💻 Step 3: Clean Coding Standards
Modular Architecture: Store logic in /js and styling in /css.

Vanilla Only: No frameworks. We believe in the power of pure JavaScript!

Manual Testing: Open index.html and ensure your changes haven't affected the timer or charts.

###📤 Step 4: Pushing Your Work

Bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added a new focus milestone notification"
git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature

###🚀 Step 5: The Pull Request (PR)

When opening your PR, ensure it includes:

Title: Concise (e.g., Fix: Responsive bug on mobile dashboard).

Reference: Link the issue using Closes #IssueNumber.

Visuals: If you change the UI, attach a screenshot or GIF.

### 🎨 Style Guidelines
✨ CSS & Design
Space: Use --spacing-lg variables for a high-end, spacious feel.

Glassmorphism: Use semi-transparent backgrounds and backdrop-filter: blur().

Themes: Use variables from themes.css. Never hardcode hex colors.

###⚡ JavaScript (ES6+)
Syntax: Use arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals.

Zero Pollution: Do not use global variables. Wrap logic in Modules or Objects.

Comments: Explain the why, not just the how.

###📬 Need a Hand?

GitHub Discussions: Best for architectural or logic questions.

GSSoC Slack/Discord: For real-time chats with the Admin team.

Let’s build something that makes the internet a more intentional place! Happy Coding! 🚀
